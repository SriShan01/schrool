          Every significant innovation often begins with a personal challenge, a
          problem that refuses to be ignored, demanding a solution both
          effective and transformative. My journey in education, specifically
          math, began with such a challenge.
          <br />
          <br />
          It wasn't something I sought out or planned; it was born out of
          necessity, fuelled by a deep desire to help my child overcome the math
          difficulties he was facing.
          <br />
          <br />
          Like many parents, I initially trusted the education system, believing
          it would provide the support my son needed to catch up. However, as
          time passed, it became evident that traditional methods weren’t
          working for him.
          <br />
          <br />
          He continued to fall behind, and this led to frustration, for both of
          us. The basic concepts that seemed straightforward to other students
          felt insurmountable for him, and despite our best efforts, progress
          was slow and painful.
          <br />
          <br />
          The realization that my son wasn’t just struggling, but actively
          losing ground, was a wake-up call. It was a moment filled with
          self-doubt and concern for his future.
          <br />
          <br />
          The frustration I felt as a parent, watching him struggle and feeling
          powerless to help, was overwhelming. I knew I had to take matters into
          my own hands if I wanted to see a real change.
          <br />
          <br />
          Determined to help, I began searching for solutions. I tried various
          tutoring programs, consulted teachers, and looked for resources, but
          nothing seemed to work.
          <br />
          <br />
          Each method felt generic, designed for the average student, and did
          not address the specific challenges my son faced.
          <br />
          <br />
          After trying countless programs without success, I realized we needed
          something different, a tailored approach that catered to his unique
          learning needs.
          <br />
          <br />
          Through this frustration, I decided to take a new direction. Drawing
          on my background in education, I began experimenting with methods
          designed specifically for my son.
          <br />
          <br />
          It was a journey of trial and error, but slowly, a personalized
          learning system began to take shape. This system allowed him to
          progress at his own pace, fully understanding each concept before
          moving on to the next.
          <br />
          <br />
          For the first time, I saw a shift in his attitude toward math. He was
          no longer dreading his homework or feeling defeated before he even
          began. Instead, he approached math with curiosity and confidence.
          <br />
          <br />
          The success of this system with my son was transformative, and I soon
          realized that other students could benefit from this approach. I began
          working with other children who were also struggling with math, and
          the results were equally encouraging.
          <br />
          <br />
          Students who had given up on math began to engage with it in new ways,
          and parents reported a significant improvement not just in math skills
          but in their children’s overall attitude toward learning.
          <br />
          <br />
          This experience led me to found Schrool, a learning system designed to
          provide personalized, step-by-step guidance for both students and
          parents.
          <br />
          <br />

          right support. Our system adapts to each student’s pace, focuses on
          building confidence, and helps parents become active participants in
          their child’s learning journey.
          <br />
          <br />
          What started as a personal challenge to help my own child has since
          grown into a comprehensive program that has helped countless families.
          <br />
          <br />
          Parents who once felt powerless now see their children thriving in
          math. The impact goes beyond academic success, it restores confidence,
          builds problem-solving skills, and fosters a love for learning that
          extends into other areas of life.
          <br />
          <br />

          take an active role in their child’s learning by guiding them through
          homework and helping them catch up.
          <br />
          <br />
          7.Students with Learning Gaps: Many children struggle in math because
          they missed foundational concepts in earlier lessons. Students who
          fell behind due to frequent school changes or personal challenges
          (like moving due to divorce) benefit greatly from a program like
          Schrool that provides step-by-step video-based explanations (Prodigy
          Game, Grade Power Learning).

          Who <span className="text-[#da07f5]">isn't</span> a good fit for our
          program:
        </h5>
        <br />
        <br />
        <p className="text-[18px] font-Poppins">
          1.Performing or above-average students: Students who are already doing
          well in math or only need minimal guidance to understand new concepts.
          <br />
          <br />
          2.Students who can solve problems after seeing one example: Those who
          quickly grasp math ideas after a single demonstration are better
          suited to programs that cater to high achievers.
          <br />
          <br />
          3.Parents looking for a hands-off solution: Families expecting a fully
          independent or automated learning system without parental involvement
          would not benefit from the structure of Schrool.
          <br />
          <br />
          4.Students who are averaging in math: If your child is already coping
          well with math in school, this program may not be the right fit. Other
          online options may provide more suitable challenges for them.
          <br />
          <br />
          5.High-Performing Students: Students who are already excelling or are
          adept at learning from a single example won’t benefit as much from the
          detailed, step-by-step support that Schrool offers. These students
          often need more advanced or challenging material to stay engaged
          (Brain Matters Learning).
          <br />
          <br />
          6.Students Looking for a Quick Fix: If your child is doing well in
          school or can solve problems quickly after one or two examples,
          Schrool’s method of breaking down each problem may feel unnecessary.
          Programs that offer less structure and more autonomy might be a better
          fit for these learners (Prodigy Game)(Tutor Doctor).
          <br />
          <br />
          7.Parents Looking for Independent Learning: Schrool’s program requires
          parental involvement. If parents are seeking a hands-off approach or
          don’t have the time to engage with their child’s learning, other
          options may be better suited (Grade Power Learning).
        </p>
